## This repo is where I’m learning Go step by step using the book A Tour of Go.

this is just my scratchpad while I pick up the language. You’ll find exercises, small programs, and notes that I write as I work through the material.

## What’s inside
- Basic Go programs straight from *A Tour of Go*  
- Experiments where I tweak the examples and see what happens  
- Notes (in code comments) whenever I run into something new or confusing
